# Computer_Vision_Final
Final Project for Computer Vision (6.869) Image Colorization Project.

This file first trains on colorized images and then returns results. The results are produced by taking an image in the colorized images folder and running the model on it so that the original picture and the model-colorized image can then be compared. 

The python file can just be run using python model.py without any arguments. Instead, line 18 must be changed to point at the directory with the colorized images. You may also have to install the necessary libraries like PIL before you run this file.
